# MineSweeper
Made by, Kiko Oliveira

This is a MineSweeper game, made using Python and Flask.
It was made for fun, its nothing amazing, expect bugs, and enjoy ^^

## Requirements

* Python3
  * Flask

## Notes

I assume Python3 is already installed, as its not hard to do so, and probably already have installed out of the box.

I tried to make the install and run as easy as possible, using .bat files for Windows and a makefile for Linux.

Advices for improvements are appreciated.


## Linux

### Install

Move to the folder `files`.
There you can run `make install` and this will install Flask.

### Runing

Move to the folder `files`.
There you can run `make run` in the bash and this will run the server.

Runing will run the server and open a tab on your default browser on the page for the game (http://localhost:5000).

NOTE: If you are using Ubuntu Bash on Windows, it will not auto open the browser. I understand vaguely why this happens, but i haven't found a simple solution to fix it.
(Let me know if you know any easy fix. Thanks.)


## Windows

### Install

Open the folder `files` and then open the `install.bat`.
This will install Flask.

### Runing

Open the folder `files` and then open the `run.bat`.

This will run the server and open a tab on your default browser on the page for the game (http://localhost:5000).
